# Multitalk AWS Project

Multitalk is an AWS-based project that leverages various AWS services to perform voice recognition, transcription, translation, and text-to-speech conversion. This project allows users to input their voice, have it recognized and transcribed, translate the transcribed text into a required language, and then convert it back into voice. It's a versatile and powerful tool for various applications, including language learning, accessibility, and more.
